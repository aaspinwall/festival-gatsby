  As Arabic type designers, weâ€™ve all had to face the challenge of creating an
  Arabic logotype that is in tune with a Latin brand. Whether working on an
  established brand or developing a logotype from scratch, creating Arabic
  adaptations for existing Latin logotype is not a matter of copy, paste and
  chop, but requires a real understanding of both Latin and Arabic script. In
  this workshop, Wissam and Majid will share the tips and tricks you need to
  work with both scripts, drawing the Arabic adaptation from scratch while
  keeping in mind the proportions and


  characteristics of the Latin logotype. You will have to create a full Arabic logotype matching a given san-serif Latin logotype, a high contrast Latin logotype, and finally a Latin logotype with free form lettering style. As a final challenge, you will have to complete a missing letter from an already designed Arabic logotype, figuring out the shape and the style of the missing letter first. Get ready to put pen to paper in this one.
