aboutworkshop: >-


  Wissam and Majid, two masters of Arabic calligraphy, join forces in a 5-hour hands-on session to give you an in-depth introduction to the history and practice of Arabic calligraphy, covering the development and different styles of Arabic calligraphy, as well as their application in various design projects. After this powerful introduction, youâ€™ll get a chance to have a go yourself, first at creating one or two words in a new modern typographic style or lettering and combining them to create a poster, then developing a calligraphic-mark using a contemporary approach, and finally developing a two-letters monogram using your own initials. Grab your pencils, fine liners, rulers, and paper and get started!
