  Shiori Takei is a Social Entrepreneur and a Community Manager at Adobe,
  certified by the Government of Japan as a Revitalization Ambassador for 2018 &
  2019. Her life-long passion for using creativity as a driving force for social
  good, has lead her to create a social design program called “Design Jimoto”
  meant to help local communities raise awareness on social challenges and solve
  them together by a design-led approach. She has collaborated with creative
  communities, as well as the Japanese government, local authorities,
  city-development organizations and educational entities. Besides her work at
  Adobe, she is busy illustrating a children’s book that aims to raise awareness
  on social issues and the power of creativity.

Prior to the residency, she worked as a freelancer for multiple agencies, startups and larger corporations, including Google. Her freelancing experience has helped her identify gaps where innovation could have transformational change. Currently she is focused on voice and task-driven design and started the podcast “Future of UX,” where she talks with UX leaders about the future of experience design. She’s dedicated to making digital design more inclusive by integrating voice into our everyday interactions with technology, while thinking beyond the screen.
